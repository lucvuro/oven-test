## How much time it took to complete or before stopping?
- It took me almost 40 minutes to complete the test .

## My feelings about the test
- First, I want to thank you for sending me the test.
- Then, I want to say that the test gave me a more realistic view of typescript. Which is not simply a type declaration, but also a consideration about converting types between components.
- This test gave me more experience in real situtation.

## What is lacking in the task definition
- I think the lacking in the task definition is the type of date string. I predict it that "dd/mm/yyyy". Sorry if it wrong. And except it, I think the task definition is clearly, completely.

## Is solution complete or not?
- Yes, my solution is complete. I think the hardest part of this task is converting date string to Timestamp(seconds number and nanos number). But if my solution has errors, I hope to get your feedback.

## Is the solution optimized or is it via brute force
- I think my solution is via brute force because Im not focusing on UI. It's a bad UI for a Frontend Developer. Sorry for that. I will try to improve if there is a chance

## How to demo
- Clone my github
- run a command: npm start
- then: localhost:3000
- Click button Click to convert
